                        The first thing that comes to mind when you think of Italian cuisine is undoubtedly pizza. Pizzas, made with a variety of ingredients, offer an option to satisfy every palate.

                        The most frequently preferred pizza recipe in Italy is Margarita, and it is consumed all over the world with its light structure and taste that appeals to every taste.

                        Ravioli, one of the favourite pasta varieties of Italian cuisine, manages to attract attention with its structure similar to the ravioli of Turkish cuisine. Ravioli is a type of stuffed pasta, often described as 'Italian dumplings.' It consists of triangular pieces of dough with serrated edges, filled with various ingredients.
                        The filling can include vegetables, cheese, meat, or fish. Ravioli is typically served with tomato-based or cream-based sauces. Ravioli filled with ricotta, a type of cheese unique to Italy, is served with tomato sauce.

                        Risotto, which is one of the favourite flavours of Northern Italy, consists of different varieties. This dish, which differs according to the region where it is made, is cooked using a special rice. Risotto can be made with a variety of ingredients such as vegetables, saffron, pumpkin, shrimp, seafood, and meat.
                        Risotto is cooked slowly in meat broth and the most preferred ingredients are white wine, onion, saffron, butter, and parmesan cheese. This type of risotto is called 'Risotto Alla Milanese".
                        Although it may resemble rice pilaf in Turkish cuisine, Risotto is enriched with special spices and ingredients, offering a unique flavor. It is often enjoyed with a glass of wine.

                        Minestrone Soup holds a special place in Italian cuisine and is a hearty winter dish dominated by vegetables. The vegetable soup includes zucchini, carrots, leeks, dried onions, celery, garlic, tomatoes, grated parmesan cheese, pasta beads, beans, meat or chicken broth, cauliflower, broccoli, basil, olive oil and salt.
                        Minestrone Soup, which has become a symbol of Italy for many years, is extremely tasty and satisfying, as well as has high nutritional value and light texture.

                    <p class="food-desc">
                        Italian ice cream contains less fat than American versions and is churned more slowly, resulting in a denser texture. Popular flavors include pistachio, hazelnut, and stracciatella. Gelato typically has 4-9% fat compared to ice cream's 14-25%, which allows the flavors to be more pronounced. It's stored and served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream, making it softer and more velvety.
                        <br><br>
                        Taking ice cream to the next level, gelato's soft, light folds are packed with layers of beautifully intense flavours. Pair flavours such as pistachio or mandorla (almond) with rich chocolate, or try fruity varieties like frutti de bosca (fruits of the forest) or pesca (peach) for a slightly more virtuous vitamin hit – the perfect antidote for a sun-filled day. If you're in southern Italy, you have to check out the regional favourite, liquirizia (liquorice).

                    <p class="food-desc">
                        Polenta is one such dish. Polenta consists of cheery yellow cornmeal, cooked with generous amounts of butter and parmesan – it's a hearty meal capable of warming the chilliest of toes. Look out for this Italian answer to mashed potato in the snowy resort of Val di Fassa.
                        You're probably familiar with the deeply tantalising flavours of salami - Italy's most famous cured meat - but it's well worth tucking into some of the lesser-known varieties. Nduja, for example, is a spreadable spicy pork sausage produced in Calabria, the arch of Italy's boot. Served as part of your pre-dinner antipasti alongside plump olives and regional cheese, it's the perfect way to start an evening.

                        Italian coffee culture revolves around espresso, which is the foundation of many popular drinks like cappuccinos and macchiatos. Italians generally enjoy espresso at the bar, often standing, and typically in the morning. They also have a variety of coffee drinks, including cappuccinos, latte macchiatos, and affogatos. In Italy, coffee is not just a beverage but a cultural ritual that brings people together throughout the day.
