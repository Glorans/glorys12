                        In Italy, <strong>family is everything</strong>.
                        Most Italians grow up with strong bonds not only with their immediate family but also with extended relatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.
                        Sunday lunches, weddings, and festivals often become big family gatherings. Respect for elders is deeply ingrained, and traditions are passed down from generation to generation. 
                        Family is seen as a source of <strong>support, identity, and pride</strong>.

                        Italian food is more than delicious – it's a <strong>cultural experience</strong>. 
                        Each meal is savored and shared, and Italians usually take time to eat and enjoy good conversation. 
                        The cuisine is based on <strong>fresh, simple ingredients</strong>: tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, basil, cheese, and pasta.
                        Different regions have their own specialties – like <strong>Neapolitan pizza</strong> in Naples, <strong>risotto</strong> in Milan, and <strong>pesto</strong> in Genoa. 
                        Italians also follow a specific meal structure: <em>antipasto</em> (starter), <em>primo</em> (first course), <em>secondo</em> (main dish), <em>contorno</em> (side dish), and <em>dolce</em> (dessert).
